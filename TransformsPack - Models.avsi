# List of Color Spaces:
#
# Color Spaces define the size and shape of our source color gamut container in the unitary XYZ coordinates cube. In other words, a color space conversion doesn't change the size (saturation), quantity (interpolation in HBD) or shape (gamut mapping) of our fruits (gamut), but the basket that holds them.
# Color Spaces are presented normally as a 3x3 matrix of their color primaries represented in the CIE 1931 diagram coordinates. This might be ok but be aware this is an over-simplification as color spaces are actually 3D volumes within the unitary XYZ cube, and part of them may actually fall outside the CIE 1931 color space which represents all the physically plausible colors.
#
# There are several types of Color Spaces defined by their role:
# Characterization spaces are normally used to represent device gamuts for profiling on a unit-to-unit basis.
# Standard spaces define a standard to comply with for delivery, normally they are derived from averaging measurements of real unit-by-unit devices defined by their used phosphors.
# Finally working spaces don't need to be attached to any physical constraints so they can be as big as the CIE 1931 color space (some actually bigger than that), so they are suited for heavy color transformations without much degradation in the process. They can also be geared towards certain effects like getting more color resolution in certain HUEs for exposing better shades in color grading tasks. Ultimately everything is being transformed into your viewing transform color space in real time so use any working space that suits your job.

# List of Color Models:
# Color Models -not to be confused with Color Spaces- describe the geometry coordinates of the color gamut container and hence its relation (or correlation) with the other channels. They are typically designed or tailored to certain Color Spaces, but not necessarily bound to them, like RGB or YCbCr which support many different Color Spaces and thus are nicked Color Absolute Models.
# Color Spaces comprises Primaries and an associated Illuminant. It is also common to be associated with a transfer function although its relationship is not as strict (as it depends on viewing conditions).
#
# UCS: Uniform Color Space. Space (model) in which equal distances on the coordinate diagram correspond to equal perceived color differences.
# With *: Color Appearance Models (CAM) (Perceptually Uniform -UCS- to various degrees)
# With +: HDR aware
# With -: Implemented
#
# CMYK         - Color model used in print industry.
#-RGB+         - RGB color model for channels Red, Green, and Blue. Normally found in interleaved packing format. AviSynth works best with planar RGB so a conversion is first needed.
#-OPP          - by Liang et al. RGB opponent space.
# NOPP         - by Liang et al.
# COPP         - by Liang et al.

# C1C2C3       - by Salvador et al.
# LSLM         - RGB opponent space based on the signals of the cones: black-white, red-green, and yellow-blue.
# YES          - by Saber et al.
# UVW          - by Ohta et al.
# SO           - Biologically Inspired Color Image Descriptor.
# c1c2c4       - Biologically Inspired Color Image Descriptor.
# o1o2         - For Robust Image Detection in Scenes under Cast Shadows. https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/30099/1/Combining%20color-based.pdf
#-YCbCr        - Color format roughly based on human perception of luma and chroma contribution (approximately perceptually uniform). Uses 3 planes for Luma, opposing blue-yellow, and opposing red-green. It's a 45º skewed parallelogram relative to the square RGB box, therefore only 23.6% of its color volume matches RGB and 76.4% is out of RGB gamut.
# YPbPr        - A model for analogue signals. It's basically the same as YCbCr but with no definition for the SMPTE range.
# YIQ          - YCbCr with (YCbCr) UV axes rotated 33º, used for NTSC TV analogue system. Quote from avisynth.nl/index.php/Tweak: "In YIQ, orange and teal are along the in-phase (I) axis, while green and magenta are along the quadrature (Q) axis. The eye is far more sensitive to detail along the I axis than along the Q axis, and NTSC allocated more bandwidth for I than for Q."
# YDbDr        - PAL-N and SECAM TV analogue format.
#-YUVr         - "YUV RCT". Same as YUV but fully reversible to RGB.
# sYUV         - "Sharp YUV". Same as YUV but luma-weighted chroma subsampling, retaining chroma fidelity.
#-YcCbcCrc     - YCbCr Constant Luminance (CL). Better decorrelation than YCbCr.
# xvYCC        - Expanded Gamut YCbCr. For newer TV systems it was/is a model that allowed the color gamut (typically Rec709) to be stored in the full range while luma in the narrow range.
#-YCoCg        - Better luma/chroma decorrelation and compression efficiency than YCbCr.
#-YCoCgR       - Same as YCoCg but losslessly reversible to RGB.
# YFbFr        - Similar to YCoCg, employs Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) to design an integer reversible transform.
#-XYZ          - CIE 1931 XYZ tristimulus color model representing all the non-imaginary colors.
# LSY          - Reads lambda-SY. Spectral color space. Representation based on brightness, dominant wavelength and saturation attributes. LSY color coordinates are defined from xyY color coordinates.
#-YDzDx+       - HDR version of XYZ. Requires at least 10-bit for no visible quantization.
# YCxCz        - Color Space for image fidelity metrics. It's a first step space, you have to "filter" it and then convert to Lab to retrieve error delta.
# DCI XYZ      - XYZ space in DCI illuminant. In effect it's just a container for DCI-P3 in XYZ coordinates for delivery to theaters.
#-Yxy/xyY      - Chroma normalized XYZ space which gives full luma/chroma decorrelation. Not apt for HDR, use YDzDx+ instead.
#-HSV          - Cylindrical representation of RGB. Not recommended as it doesn't take into account human luminance perception.
#-Duv*         - Perceptual based model which measures the closest distance from the Planckian locus on the CIE 1976 (u', 2/3 v') diagram. Some color spaces and Delta metrics are computed in this model which is an update of the CIE 1960 UCS chromaticity diagram. A white point defined in Duv coordinates is called a "color tint".
# HunterLab*   - A more perceptually uniform version of CIELab.
#-CIELab*      - Derived from CIE XYZ, one of the first approaches to a perceptually uniform color model. CIELch(ab) is its cylindrical (polar coordinates) version. You can derive it's Delta E with the next equation: DE = (DL^2 + Da^2 + Db^2)/2  = ( (Ly-Lx)^2 + (ay-ax)^2 + (by-bx)^2)/2.
# CIEsLab*     - CIE simple Lab.
# R-Lab*       - Ruderman Lab space, using log luma and different weights for ab.
# L-Lab*       -
# SRLab2*      - A 2009 modification of CIELab in the spirit of RLAB. Uses CIECAM02 chromatic adaptation matrix to fix the blue hue issue.
#-CIELuv*      - CIE 1976. Derived from CIE 1964 UVW, a competing perceptually uniform color model of CIELab around the same time the latter appeared. CIELuv uses a Judd-type CAT, while CIELab uses "wrong" von-Kries (XYZ Scaling).
#   CIELch(uv)*- HCL (polar coordinates or cylindrical) version of CIELuv.
#   HSLuv*     - A cylindrical HSL type adaptation of CIELuv. It extends CIELuv with a new saturation component that allows you to span all the available chroma as a neat percentage.
# LogLuv*+     - HDR version of CIELuv, that uses log to encode HDR values in a 15-bit container.
# Y''U''V''*+  - HDR version of CIELuv by Charles Poynton. Improves on LogLuv by using a PQ transfer which just needs 12-bits.
# CIEDuDv*+    - or YDuDv. HDR version of CIE Luv. Requires only 8-bit for no visible quantization.
# CIECAM97s*   -
#-XYB*         - Uniform (UCS) space used in Guetzli's butteraugli metric and JPEG-XL, with a main goal in compression. Better uniformity than CIE Lab.
# DIN99o*      -
# JzAzBz*+     - A 2017 uniform (UCS) space designed for HDR color. Has J (lightness) and two chromaticities. JzCzhz is the HCL (polar coordinates or cylindrical) version of JzAzBz.
#-IPT*         - Intensity Protanope Tritanope. A more uniform color space in SDR colors. There's a version called hdrIPT.
# IgPgTg       - Based on IPT but optimized using gaussian spectra to derive a hue-linear color space.
# ICaCb+       - Precursor and arguably better color model than ICtCp which based on this.
#-ICtCp+       - BT.2100 (HDR + Rec.2020) version of IPT. HDR version of YcCbcCrc but with Constant Intensity this time.
# ITP*+        - Perceptually uniform color space version of ICtCp, used extensively in error metrics by scaling Ct by 0.5. This transformation is the basis of the Rec.2124 wide gamut color difference metric D.itp (simple scaled Euclidean distance: 720*sqrt(Di^2+D(t*0.5)^2+Dp^2) )
# IPTPQc2*+    - Improved HDR10 version of ICtCp. Since it's a propietary model not much information is known.
# CIECAM02*    - Improves on CIECAM97s and can be made uniform with CAM02-UCS. CIECAM02Jch is its cylindrical version.
# OSA*         -
# CIECAM16*    - Improves on CIECAM02 and can be made uniform with CAM16-UCS, which works "out-of-the-box" for Euclidean distance metrics.
# ZCAM*+       - A uniform (UCS) space for HDR color.
#-Oklab*       - A uniform (UCS) space for SDR color. Simple to compute yet powerful. Takes CAM16 lightness and chroma, and IPT for hue. OkLch is the cylindrical form of Oklab.
# iCAM06       - An image (not only color) appearance metric model to not only compute perceived difference in lightness, hue or chroma, but also contrast, sharpness or graininess. Involves converting to IPT, low-pass filtering in linear space, convert to non-linearity, then to Jch model and QM if necessary for the metrics.
