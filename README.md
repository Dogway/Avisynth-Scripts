# Avisynth Scripts

A collection of Avisynth Filters I made in the past. They were designed with Avisynth 2.58 and 2.60 versions in mind, but will also work with the current Avisynth+, although some of them have been natively updated like SMDegrain and some of my mod versions [link](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=174121).

Unfortunately some still haven't been updated but are fully functional in Avisynth+ like MasksPack or ResizersPack which are really valuable and a staple on my filter folder. They are related function collections that speeds up the creation of masks or resizing to a certain format. The help is included commented inside the script.

For a full description of each check the original forum thread in [VideoHelp](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/369143-ResizersPack-MasksPack-PlaygroundPack-SmoothContrast-Logo-mod-functions).
