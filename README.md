# AviSynth+ Scripts

Collection of AviSynth+ Filters. They were originally designed with Avisynth 2.58 and 2.60 versions in mind, but will also work with the current Avisynth+ versions and I'm slowly updating them to modern code (about 80% done) which has much greater performance and supports HBD (high bit depths). Some of them have been natively updated by thirds like SMDegrain and some of my mod versions ([link](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=174121)).
